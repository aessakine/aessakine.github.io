excerpt: 'Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a paradigm in knowledge represen
tation, offering exceptional flexibility and performance across a diverse range of applications.
 INRs leverage multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to model data as continuous implicit func
tions, providing critical advantages such as resolution independence, memory efficiency, and
 generalisation beyond discretised data structures. 
 Their ability to solve complex inverse problems makes them particularly effective for tasks including audio reconstruction, image
 representation, 3D object reconstruction, and high-dimensional data synthesis.
 This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art INR methods, introducing a clear
 taxonomy that categorises them into four key areas: activation functions, position encod
ing, combined strategies, and network structure optimisation. We rigorously analyse their
 critical properties—such as full differentiability, smoothness, compactness, and adaptability
 to varying resolutions—while also examining their strengths and limitations in addressing
 locality biases and capturing fine details. Our experimental comparison offers new insights
 into the trade-offs between different approaches, showcasing the capabilities and challenges
 of the latest INR techniques across various tasks. In addition to identifying areas where cur
rent methods excel, we highlight key limitations and potential avenues for improvement, such
 as developing more expressive activation functions, enhancing positional encoding mecha
nisms, and improving scalability for complex, high-dimensional data. This survey serves as
 a roadmap for researchers, offering practical guidance for future exploration in the field of
 INRs. We aim to foster new methodologies by outlining promising research directions for
 INRs and applications.'
