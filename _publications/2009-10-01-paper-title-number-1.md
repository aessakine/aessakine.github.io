excerpt: 'Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) model data as continuous functions with MLPs, yielding resolution independence, compact memory use, and strong generalization. This survey reviews state-of-the-art INRs along four axes—activation functions, positional encoding, combined strategies, and network design—examining properties like differentiability, smoothness, compactness, and multi-resolution adaptability. We benchmark methods on audio/image representation, 3D reconstruction, and high-dimensional synthesis, highlighting trade-offs, locality biases, and limits in capturing fine detail. Finally, we outline key directions—more expressive activations, stronger positional encodings, and improved scalability—offering a roadmap for future INR research.'
